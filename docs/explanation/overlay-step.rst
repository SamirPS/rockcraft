Overlay step
============

The component parts of a ROCK are built in a sequence of
five separate steps: pull, overlay, build, stage and prime.

To learn more about pull,overlay,build,stage and prime see `Part lifecycle <https://snapcraft.io/docs/parts-lifecycle#heading--steps>`_ 
 
The overlay step is specific to ROCKs and is configured with overlay parameters.

.. Include a section about overlay parameters from the Craft Parts documentation.
